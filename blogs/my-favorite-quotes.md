description: Quotes that struck a chord with me
---

Back in 2022 I used to journal daily. I started each journal with a quote I found online. Here's a couple of the ones that heavily aligned with me.

## Destiny

> _Aut viam inveniam aut faciam - Hannibal of Carthage_

This is one of my favorite quotes. This translates to "I shall either find a way or make one".

#### A little history lesson

The Roman empire went face-to-face with Ancient Carthage in their imperial ambitions. Over the course of 3 wars spanning over a century, Rome lay seige to the Carthaginian empire. During the [second war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Punic_War), Hannibal, a Carthaginian general, led his army towards Italy. In an effort to surprise the Romans he would have to cross the Alps by elephant. His generals advised him that this would be impossible due to the harsh climate, to which he responded with the above quote.

#### Is everything pre-determined

Fate and destiny have been a hot topic throughout the generations. The stoics believed that everything happens due to a providential order (Logos). Camus believed in the absurd — life is inherently meaningless and that we, as individuals, must create our own purpose in a purposeless world.

I hold the view of a _slight_ [compatibilist](https://www.qcc.cuny.edu/socialSciences/ppecorino/INTRO_TEXT/Chapter%207%20Freedom/Freedom_Compatibilism.htm) — the view that free will is compatible with determinism. A tl;dr of it would be that compatibilists think that free will involves acting according to one's internal states (desires, motivations, etc.) without external coercion. Where I differ is that I also believe in Karma — a form of moral determinism where my previous and current actions influence my future life circumstances.

What does any of this have to do with the quote? We don't know what the future holds. Maybe it is all pre-determined and no matter what you do you will end up in the exact same place, or that you are in complete control of everything that happens to you.

Take having a successfull business for example; we only hear about the winners, the ones that ended up exiting via an acquisition or IPO and are know worth millions or even billions. For each successful business, there is a graveyard of failed businesses right alongside them. We don't hear about them because nobody cares about the one that came second. The spotlight is always on the victors, the ones who made it big, while the stories of those who tried and failed fade into obscurity. This does not mean that their efforts were worthless and that their journeys were in vain.

Every failed attempt holds lessons that are invaluable. These stories of struggle and persistance are the backbone of innovation and progress. They remind us that the path to success is rarely a straight line. In fact, many of those that failed more often than not, end up later succeeding in their endeavours; likely using their failures as lighthouses in the ocean of uncertainty.

#### So what then?

Hannibal's quote embodies the spirit of perseverance and determination. It's crucial to keep pushing forward and create your own path. Whether you succeed or fail, whether the future is pre-determined or not, every step you take is a testament to your resilience and drive.

## Legacy

Birthday 2022:

> _But how could you live and have no story to tell - Fyodor Dostoevsky (Russian Novelist, 1821-1881)_

## Ephemeral

> _The trouble is, you think you have time - Jack Kornfield (American Writer & Buddhist Practitioner - Wrote "Buddha's Little Instruction Book")_

## Forgiveness

> _To understand everything is to forgive everything - Madame de Staël_

The original saying is in French — "Car tout comprendre rend très indulgent, et sentir profondément inspire une grande bontée ("**To understand everything makes one tolerant, and to feel deeply inspires great kindness**").

Have you ever been in a situation where you knew your actions were right, but others couldn't see it? Because the details of the situation were overlooked, you were perceived as the one at fault. It's frustrating, yet you have likely done the same to others many times before.

Deep comprehension of a person's motives, and circumstances leads naturally to a sense of forgiveness. By understanding the full context of someone's behavior or situation, one might find it easier to empathize with them and forgive any **perceived** wrongs.

#### Empathy

Empathy isn't exclusive to just the human race, it's part of many mammals. For example, in 1964 a group pf psychiatrists led by [Jules Masserman](http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=jaa.006.0001a) reported that rhesus monkeys refused to pull a chain that delivered food to themselves if doing so gave a shock to a companion. One monkey going so far as stopping pulling the chain for 12 days after witnessing another monkey receive a shock.

Empathy likely evolved in mammals in the context of parental care. Signaling their current state through smiling and crying, human infants urge their parents to respond. This also applies to other primates. During the millions of years of mamallian evolution, females who were cold and distant to their offspring were out-reproduced by those who responded to their needs.

Tying back to the original point, our original judgments and feelings of resentment or anger can be modified when we take the time to understand the underlying factors that contribute to another person's actions. Empathy paves the way for forgiveness
