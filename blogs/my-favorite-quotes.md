description: Quotes that struck a chord with me
---

Back in 2022 I used to journal daily. I started each journal with a quote I found online. Here's a couple of the ones that heavily aligned with me.

## Destiny

> _Aut viam inveniam aut faciam - Hannibal of Carthage_

This is one of my favorite quotes. This translates to "I shall either find a way or make one".

## Legacy

Birthday 2022:

> _But how could you live and have no story to tell - Fyodor Dostoevsky (Russian Novelist, 1821-1881)_

## Ephemeral

> _The trouble is, you think you have time - Jack Kornfield (American Writer & Buddhist Practitioner - Wrote "Buddha's Little Instruction Book")_

## Forgiveness

> _To understand everything is to forgive everything - Madame de StaÃ«l (French-speaking Swiss author; 1766 - 1817)_
