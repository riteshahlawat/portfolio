Great, you accepted an offer from a US company that is willing to sponsor you! The hard part is over. All those hours you spent prepping and conducting the multiple interview rounds were worth it ‚Äî you finally did it. Now you can finally relax... well not so fast.

> This is a lengthy article that details all that you might need to do to apply for a visa as well as stuff that I wish I knew for my move (moving furniture, apartment, bank accounts, social security, etc.)

## Getting a Work Visa

There are two different types of work visas in the US. An immigration visa and a non-immigration visa. Unless you can qualify in one of the following _rare_ cases:

-   Your current company has US offices ([L-1 visa](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/l-1a-intracompany-transferee-executive-or-manager))
-   You are investing a substantial amount of money in a US business ([E-2 visa](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/e-2-treaty-investors))
-   Have extraordinary ability in sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics ([O-1 visa](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/o-1-visa-individuals-with-extraordinary-ability-or-achievement))

You are left with the [TN visa](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/tn-nafta-professionals) and the [H-1B](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/h-1b-specialty-occupations). The TN visa is a non-immigrant meaning you intend to return to Canada eventually. The H-1B visa is a dual intent visa meaning you could have intentions of living in the US in the future.

H-1Bs are usually provided by bigger companies due to their larger financial resources, legal teams, and track record. This article will focus on the TN visa, so if you're not interested you can click off üòÅ.

### Wtf is a TN???

TN stands for Trade NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement). It is for Canadians and Mexicans who fall under certain criteria. Those being:

-   You are a citizen of either Canada or Mexico (we will be talking only about Canada in this post)
-   You have at minimum a Bachelor's degree at an acredited university
-   You have an offer letter from a US company
-   Your degree is related to the job in the offer letter
-   The job must be a NAFTA profession (see full list [here](https://tnvisaexpert.com/tn-visa-usmca/nafta-job-list/))
