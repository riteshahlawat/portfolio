description: Stuff you should know when planning to move to the US on a TN work visa.

Great, you accepted an offer from a US company that is willing to sponsor you! The hard part is over. All those hours you spent prepping and conducting the multiple interview rounds were worth it — you finally did it. Now you can finally relax... well not so fast.

> This is a lengthy article that details all that you might need to do to apply for a visa as well as stuff that I wish I knew for my move (moving furniture, apartment, bank accounts, social security, etc.)

## Getting a Work Visa

There are two different types of work visas in the US. An immigration visa and a non-immigration visa. Unless you can qualify in one of the following _rare_ cases:

-   Your current company has US offices ([L-1 visa](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/l-1a-intracompany-transferee-executive-or-manager))
-   You are investing a substantial amount of money in a US business ([E-2 visa](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/e-2-treaty-investors))
-   Have extraordinary ability in sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics ([O-1 visa](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/o-1-visa-individuals-with-extraordinary-ability-or-achievement))

You are left with the [TN visa](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/tn-nafta-professionals) and the [H-1B](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/h-1b-specialty-occupations). The TN visa is a non-immigrant meaning you intend to return to Canada eventually. The H-1B visa is a dual intent visa meaning you could have intentions of living in the US in the future.

H-1Bs are usually provided by bigger companies due to their larger financial resources, legal teams, and track record. This article will focus on the TN visa, so if you're not interested you can click off 😁.

### Wtf is a TN???

TN stands for Trade NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement). It is for Canadians and Mexicans who fall under certain criteria. Those being:

-   You are a citizen of either Canada or Mexico (we will be talking only about Canada in this post)
-   You have at minimum a Bachelor's degree at an acredited university
-   You have an offer letter from a US company
-   Your degree is related to the job in the offer letter
-   The job must be a NAFTA profession (see full list [here](https://tnvisaexpert.com/tn-visa-usmca/nafta-job-list/))

### How do I get one?

> For those whose degree is different from their offer letter (Ex: Degree is in Biology but have an offer for a Product Manager role) see [here](#getting-a-work-visa)

Getting a TN visa is pretty straight forward. You can get it at the border. Yeah I was surprised when I first heard this too. You apply right at customs if you're flying or at the border station if you're driving out. It only costs $50 USD as well.

I applied at the airport before my flight so I can tell you about my experience with that. Right after you get passed security (where they check your carry-on and stuff), you'll have to get in line to meet with a US customs officer. They will ask you your purpose for coming into the states and you will mention that you are looking to apply for a TN visa and they'll take your fingerprint and passport and take you to a separate room to wait for your interview.

### The dreaded interview

Depending on how busy it is, it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours to go through the entire process so I'd reccommend coming 4 hours before your flight. Another thing to note is the time at which the customs office opens. I made the mistake of booking my flight too early in the day. At Pearson (Toronto airport), the customs office opened at 3:30 AM and my flight was at 6:30 AM and due to "delays" at the customs office, I ended up missing my flight after getting my visa (United rebooked me free of charge).

After sitting for a bit you will be called up for your interview. This part is pretty hit or miss. Officers have the right to reject your visa and there are many such cases of this happening

![Reddit Visa Denied](/images/blog/reddit-visa-denied.jpg)

Here's what you have to bring to your interview (all printed):

-   A support letter from your employer which contains your official title, job duties and responsibilities, the start date and end date, your salary (**and how often you will be paid, i.e. semi-monthly, annually, etc**), your educational qualifications, and previous work experience (especially in similar roles) can help.
-   Your offer letter
-   A copy of your official transcript
-   A copy of your official degree (I brought my official degree as well but they just need a copy of it for their records)

#### Some things to consider

-   The TN visa can last up to 3 years from where it can be renewed again either by
    -   You or your employer filing the USCIS a Form I-129 by mail (up to 6 months prior to expiration or within 10 days of the expiration)
    -   Leaving the US and re-applying at the border

### How I almost got rejected

Now I knew that border agents can deny you pretty easily, but I didn't know how easily. After waiting for about 10 minutes I get called up by the border agent lady. She asks for my letter and I ask for which letter (as I had both an offer letter and a support letter from my employer). She then says sternly, **"_your letter_."**, by now in my head I know she's one of the border agents I've read about that can deny me on the smallest of things.

I pull out my booklet containing my documents. By booklet I mean the papers were hole punched and binded together (there were about 60 pages in total so I bounded them together so they wouldn't fall apart). She takes the booklet, looks at me with a disgusted face, and says **"_I can't accept this, I'm going to send you back from where you came from_"**.

Now when I tell you I was **SHITTING MY PANTS**, I'm not kidding. She then says that she needs to photocopy them and can't when it's binded, I tell her my lawyers told me to have them bounded (they most certainly didn't LOL but if I could get away with shifting the blame I'd take it). She then replies with **"_Well you can tell them that when you get sent back_"**

![Woe is me](/images/blog/crying-creature.png)

I apologize and say it's my first time and that I can unbind them. She tells me to go sit down and that she will call me again. I then wait two hours... I get called up and hand in my papers as she asks for them. Support letter, offer letter, degree, transcript. She photocopies them and hands them back. She then gives me a form to fill out that details my address (I put the hotel I was staying at), my work address, my work's phone number, and the duties I will be performing at my job and their relative percentage.

Make sure the duties you fill in correspond to what's in your support letter. After handing it in she then prints out piece of paper and directs me to the payment section where I have to go and pay the $50 USD for the visa. At this point a weight is lifted off my shoulders because I know I have gotten the visa. After paying the fees, I wait another 20 minutes and she gives my passport with a TN visa stamp on it.

Unfortunately, due to the time I was stuck waiting, I missed my flight. Thankfully, United rescheduled me for the evening for free!!! I just had to update when I was picking up my rental car to the next day, which leads to the next section.

## Planning for the move

Everyone's move is different. One person could just be bringing a few suitcases whereas another person is moving their entire apartment and the furniture along with it. I'll talk about what I did and give suggestions for alternatives. First things first, you want to get 4 things booked once you get your support letter: Flight, Hotel, Rental Car, and Apartment tours.

### Flight

You can enter the US on a TN visa up to 10 days before your start date. This will give you time to get settled. I booked my flight through Google Flights but that was after checking out prices from other services like Hopper and Expedia.

> If you have an Amex, you might be able to save more by converting your amex points to air miles and purchasing a flight with those air miles. Do your research!

### Hotel

I would recommend getting a hotel for 3-4 days as a temporary place to stay while you look for an apartment and sign a lease. It's better to only book for a couple days, you can always extend your stay if you need to. I would compare local hotel prices with Airbnb as sometimes one may be drastically cheaper than the other. I was moving to Sillicon Valley and the hotels were cheaper than the Airbnbs. For those looking for a nice place to stay, the [Good Nite Inn](https://www.goodnite.com/ "Good Nite Inn Website") in Redwood City was only $99/night and was kept up really well!

### Rental Car

As much as you might dislike car-centric infrastructure, this one is almost a necessity. The transit infrastructure here sucks which is a surprise especially if you come from a city like Toronto (even though the transit infrastructure in SE Asian countries are much [better](https://www.tokyometro.jp/en/subwaymap/index.html "Tokyo Subway Map")). You're going be busy for the first 10 days going from place to place so you **need** a car.

For those in the Bay area, check out [Kyte](https://kyte.com/ "Kyte - car rental company"). They can be significantly cheaper compared to other rental companies. I was able to rent a 2023 Volkswagon Tiguan (SUV) for 13 days for under $600! If you're bringing your own car for the move, this obviously isn't necessary.

### Apartment Tours

Apartments, depending on when you where you're working can be really cheap or really fucking expensive. My guess is you're going to somewhere that's really expensive. Since this is going to be somewhere you're living for the next couple years, I recommend putting a lot of effort here. You want to be searching for apartments through multiple different websites and app. Some I recommend are: [zillow](https://www.zillow.com/ "Zillow website"), [apartment list](https://www.apartmentlist.com/ "Apartment List website"), and [apartments](https://www.apartments.com/ "apartments.com website"). Create a shortlist of the apartments 1-2 weeks out from your move and reach out for tours.

> If you plan your start date around a week after the 1st of a month, that can set you up perfectly as many apartments free up around the 1st.

Be aiming to look at 4-5 apartments a day (which is why you need a car, commuting is too slow and ride share is too expensive). Spread them out 2-3 hours from one another which will give you time to eat and do other things.

#### For those in the bay area

The bay area can be pretty expensive especially if you're looking to move in San Francisco. My work was in Mountain View so I was looking for places within 15-20 minute drive from work. Despite me hearing that I'd end up spending $3000 a month on the lease for a 1b1b, I ended up finding a 2b1b for $2695 in Santa Clara (15 minutes away), and it even has a pool, jacuzzi, and EV charging 😎. Some tips:

-   Look daily, even while you've already have rental viewings lined up. You might end up finding a gem that was posted 23 minutes ago, you can always cancel appointments anyways!
-   2 bedroom apartments are not as hot on the market as 1 bedroom apartments and you might find one that is only a couple hundred more. You could share that extra room with someone or use it as an office
-   The most important one:

##### Electricity Providers

Your electric bill will eat up most of the extra expenses on top of rent. The bay area has 2 providers regarding electricity, [P&E](https://www.pge.com/en.html "Pacific Gas and Electric Company") and [SVP](https://www.siliconvalleypower.com/ "Silicon Valley Power"). These two have **DRASTICALLY** different prices. P&E is far more expensive than SVP so make sure to factor that into your search and ask:

## The 10 days before you start

You've arrived from your airport, you got your rental car, and have a bunch of apartment viewings booked for the next couple days. That's it right?... well no.

### I-94

### Social Security

A social security number is very important in the US. It's a unique identifier used by the government to track your earnings and determine your eligibility for benefits. You need it when signing up for credit cards, taking loans, and your employer will ask that you get one within the first couple weeks.
